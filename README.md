#IEEE ICDM 2018 Global A.I. Challenge on Meteorology
## Catch Rain If You Can
The A.I. Challenge

A.I. marvels will be given big data of heavy rain suspects in form of historical weather radar pictures (collectively referred to as SRAD2018, jointly developed by SZMB and HKO).  Different suspects have different rainfall severity and tracking patterns, which have to be learned thoroughly and classified precisely during the data mining process using cutting-edge machine learning / A.I. technologies. In the end, the A.I. “shields” so built shall be smart enough to catch new heavy rain suspects given unseen clues with foresights on their future crime pattern up to three hours ahead (i.e. where? when? and how severe to rain?).
